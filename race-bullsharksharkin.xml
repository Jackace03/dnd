			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size. </em></strong> Bull Sharkin can grow to be between 4 to 5 feet tall and weigh up too 150 to 200 lbs. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Oceanic Rage. </em></strong>You may enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain a +2 to damage rolls at 1st level, +3 at 9th, and +4 at 16th. You have advantage on Strength Checks and Strength saving throws. You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can end your rage as a bonus action, and once you have raged you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent"><strong><em>Vicious Bite.</em></strong>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a vicious bite attack. This is a natural weapon attack with which you are proficient with and uses your Strength modifier for its attack rolls. This bite does 1d8 bludgeoning damage, but grows to 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 10th level, and 4d8 at 20th level.</p>
